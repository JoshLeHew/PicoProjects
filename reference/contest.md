## Goal
 You've been provided with hardware kits and instructions to learn how to use the different components in your kits.  
 
 You will follow the labs to learn about the different components and how to control them through code on the RaspberryPi Pico.
 Your goal is to take what you learn to build a game.  The final 3 labs will walk you through building our prototype laser shark game.

 If possible, the ultimate goal would be to build on what you learn to create your own unique game.
 
 You can add new features in code or hardware to our prototype game or come up with something brand new.
 

## General Tips
1) In your kits, you may have several strands of colored wires stuck together.  You can strip wires apart by gently grabbing two different colored wires next to each other and pulling them apart.
1) The colors of the wires or their length don't really matter.  Typically black or white wires go to the negative terminal, also known as ground, and the red wires usually go to positive voltage.  But the colors are only for human readability and so it doesn't matter if you replace a red wire with a blue wire from the standpoint of making it work.
1) Reconfiguring the wires is ok to make things easier to reach or access buttons, but probably won't get you extra points.


## Judging
1) After completing each of the final labs, reach out to a judge to have them check your work and give you credit for what you've done.
1) On the scorecard for innovation, the last item mentions adding a previously unused hardware component to the final solution.  You should be given one point for **each** additional hardware component added. For example, adding two new buttons that provide new features, could gain you two points.
