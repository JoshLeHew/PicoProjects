## Raspberry Pi Pico Pins


The Raspberry Pi Pico has 40 pins.  A majority of these are General Purpose Input/Output(GPIO) Pins.
These GPIO pins allow you to send or receive signals with the Pico.  A smaller number of the pins that are NOT GPIO pins, are used for Ground or Power.
Ground pins are the 3rd pin from each end on each side. There are also two other ground pins on each side spaced 5 pins from the first ground pins.

**NOTE**: While the pins have a physical numbering from 1 to 40.  In the code you never use the logical numbering of the pins, but instead use the GP# for each pin.

So, use the image below as a reference to know the GPIO pin numbers.  In the code you will use the number after the "GP" label.
