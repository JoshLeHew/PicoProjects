# PicoProjects

Projects/Sample code for Raspberry Pi Pico

We start with a basic introduction to circuits and some basic electronics.  Without this foundational knowledge, it will be difficult to build useful solutions that integrate code and electronics.

## Intro to Circuits.

Simple circuit with LED using power from Pico and turn on LED. 
- Use 3.3v from Pico and Blue LED to support Voltage.

## Resistors.

Same simple circuit from above and just add resistors to control the brightness of the LED.

## Variable Resistors (Photoresistor)

Replace resistor with photo resistor and see LED dim and brighten based on light going into photoresisotor

## Variable Resistor Potentiometer

Replace Photo resistor with Potentiometer to control brightness of LED

## Buttons/Switches

Go back to normal resistor and then add a button in the circuit so that the LED only comes on when the button is pressed.

## Control LED from Pico

Remove button and wire LED to Pico and ground.  Then write code to blink LED. Maybe blink on board LED first.
- Stretch goal: having more than one LED.

## Read input (button input)

Hook the button up to the Pico and code it so that the light comes on only when the button is pressed, but have the code detect when the button is pressed and control when the LED comes on.
- stretch goal: make it so that the LED comes on with one press of the button and stays on and then turns off with a second press of the button.
