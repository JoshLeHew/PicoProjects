# PicoProjects

Projects/Sample code for Raspberry Pi Pico


## Intro to Circuits.

Simple circuit with LED using power from Pico and turn on LED. 
- Use 3.3v from Pico and Blue LED to support Voltage.

## Resitors.

Same simple circuit from above and just add resistors to control the brightness of the LED.

## Variable Resistors (Photoresistor)

Replace resistor with photo resistor and see LED dim and brighten based on light going into photoresisotor

## Buttons/Switches

Go back to normal resistor and then add a button in the circuit so that the LED only comes on when the button is pressed.
