# FIRE ZEE LASERS!!!!1!!

## Overview

You are now well prepared for our final objective.  What's a mad scientist pre-compiler without a little fun with lasers and target practice??

In this part 1 of 3 for our final game you will do the following:

- Detect a button press (use various button labs as a reference)... if this happens the pico should FIRE ZEE LASER and the photores (our target) needs to read the current value (use various button labs as a reference).
- Once the button has been pressed we need to lock out the player from another attempt for 5 seconds (use debounce lab as a reference)

  
 ## What to do

TODO: Insert diagram here of breadboard with button, laser, andd photores connected

Once you have the pico wired, take some time to attempt to code the points outlined in the overview using the old labs.

TODO: List some specific code snippets from previous

If using the Pico W the internal pin for the LED is NOT 25.  It's the string "LED". So, assuming you flashed your Pico W with the right MicroPython library(the one for the Pico W), then the led line above would look like this for the Pico W:
```Python
TODO: put the solution here
```

If you got all of this to work, do your best Dr. Evil laugh at a volume that the instructors are sure to hear!  It's finally time for some sharks with some lasers on their heads.
