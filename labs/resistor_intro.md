# Resistors

As we saw in the last lab LED's (like most electronics) have voltage ranges in which they are designed to run.  We are currently running off 3.3Volts, but if we look again at the specifciations for the LEDs, we will see we are actually running a little over the specified voltage range of 3.0 to 3.2V.

Since we are barely over spec we most likely won't have an issue, but it would be safer for the lifespan of the LED to run at a lower voltage.  To do this, we will add a resistor into our circuit.  A resistor simply resists the flow of electricity and will drop our voltage to a safer level.
