# Three Lives and a Scoreboard

## Overview

In this grand finale for our game you will do the following:

- Add a seven segment display to keep score
- Add logic for a successful target hit:
  - Make your buzzer buzz a happy buzz
  - Add one point to the hit counter (make sure it updates on your seven segment display)
  - Double the step of the pwm running in the thread to speed up your shark to make each level harder to beat
- Add logic for a missed laser fire:
  - Make your buzzer buzz a sad buzz
  - Darken one of the three LEDs (you start with 3 lives)
- Add logic for once you run out of lives to buzz a fun little buzz indicating the game has ended.


## What to do

Once you have the pico wired and the game stage set as seen above, take some time to attempt to code the points outlined in the overview using the old labs, building on your code from the Sharks With Laser Beams lab.

TODO: give helpful hint on setting a baseline photores value to determine if a hit happened or not from the laser

TODO: List some specific code snippets from previous labs to help guide them

TODO: Explain lining up the servo on the shark/ruler with a start/stop or a simple set degree command they can send in the console

**NOTE**<details><summary>If you've given that a good effort and need a little guidance check out the code solution by clicking here.</summary> 
```Python
TODO: put the solution here
```
</details>




If you got all of this to work, then go for a new high score!  and then another!  and then another!  and then another!
