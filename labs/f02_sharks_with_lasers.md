# One Simple Request: Sharks with Frickin Laser Beams

## Overview

In this part 2 of 3 for our final game you will do the following:

- Setup the game stage on our trusty rulers (image below)
- Mount the laser to your sharkhead
- Mount the servo on the ruler end cap
- Mount the shark on the servo (see below for setting "home" on your servo)
- Wire the photo resistor to our target and place the target end cap on the opposite side of the ruler
- Add code that will pan our servo back and forth (in its own thread)
- Add code to manage the lighting of 3 separate LEDs (default all start out turned on)
- Create a function that will turn off one of the remaining lit LEDs


## What to do

TODO: Insert diagram here of breadboard with servo and 3 LEDs added

Once you have the pico wired and the game stage set as seen above, take some time to attempt to code the points outlined in the overview using the old labs, building on your code from the Fire Zee Lasers Lab.

TODO: List some specific code snippets from previous labs to help guide them

TODO: Explain lining up the servo on the shark/ruler with a start/stop or a simple set degree command they can send in the console

```Python

If you made it this far, stand up, stretch, and give someone a fist bump!
