# Potentiometer

## Overview

We used our first type of variable resistor in the last lab when we used the Photoresistor.  In this lab we will use another type of variable resistor the Potentiometer.

## Potentiometer

A Potentiometer(pictured below) is a type of variable resistor that provides a different level of resistence based on the position of the knob.  By turning the knob ontop of the potentiometer, you can vary the resistence it provides.  The type of Potentiometer we are using is often referred to a as a trim potentiometer or "trim pot" for short.

 ## What to do

For this lab, we will replace the photoresistor in our circuit with our potentiometer.  So remove the photoresistor that connects the long side of the LED currently in column 30 to the power rail. 

Add the potentiometer to the breadboard making sure the side with the slots are near the middle section of the breadboard.  Make sure the 3 pins of the potentiometer are in different columns.  The far right pin when looking at the slots should go into the breadboard at Row G and column 25. This should position the middle pin into the breadboard at Row F and column 24.

With the potentiometer in place, connect the far left pin to our power rail. So, that should mean connecting a wire from the positive power rail to Column 23.  
Now connect the middle pin of the potentiometer which is in column 24 to the long leg of the LED in column 30.  Now connect the last pin (far right pin) of the potentiometer to ground.  That is run a wire from Column 25 to the ground(negative) rail.

If everything is connected properly you should be able to twist the knob ontop of the potentiometer and see the LED dim and brighten.  

If it works high five someone nearby.
